# x3ro-billomat-rb

A neat ruby library for interacting with the [RESTful API](http://www.billomat.com/api/) of [Billomat](http://www.billomat.com/). Forked from [here](https://github.com/rbecher/billomat-rb).

<h1>Work in progress - Not all functionality availabe in the API is accessible yet</h1>

# Requirements

billomat-rb requires `active_resource` and `active_support` in version 3.2.3 or above.


# Examples

    TODO: Add link to usage examples (they will be located in the main module's comments)


# Notes

Documentation is generated using

    rake yard # or
    yard doc


# Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
